    "\n",
    "One of the major benefits of tools like Jupyter are that it makes it easy to strip away the \"boilerplate\" that comes with programming languages; some of these exercises relies on a little bit more of that than in weeks past. If you get confused or something stops working, email your TA or come to ofice hours."

Don't print anything out, don't do anything with the file, don't do anything. Just quit. If the file *doesn't* exist, complain, and prompt the user for a filename again. Do this until the user gives you a valid filename or pours water on their computer in frustration. (Just kidding. Don't pour water on your computer.)\n",
